# Backend Pendencies

Every screen spec under `Docs/specs/` is checked against what the CourseCore
backend (`c:\Users\leonardo.silva\source\repos\CourseCore`) actually exposes.
When a mockup asks for something the backend doesn't support today, it's
recorded here — one file per screen, mirroring `Docs/specs/<domain>/<feature>.md`
— instead of only living inside prose in the spec itself, so the full list can
be handed to backend work without re-reading every spec.

Each pendency entry states what the mockup expects, what the backend
actually has today (with the source evidence), what closing the gap would
require, the workaround shipped instead, and a rough severity:

- **Blocking** — the screen's core feature has no viable data path at all.
- **Feature gap** — a real capability is simply missing; the workaround is a
  stub or reduced scope.
- **Cosmetic** — decorative/informational only; the screen works without it.
- **Config** — not a backend code gap, just missing credentials/secrets.

## Index

| Screen | File | Worst severity |
|---|---|---|
| Landing (`/`) | [landing/landing-page.md](landing/landing-page.md) | Resolved (2026-09-07) |
| Register (`/register`) | [auth/register.md](auth/register.md) | Config |
| Login (`/login`) | [auth/login.md](auth/login.md) | Feature gap |
| Confirm email (`/confirm-email`) | [auth/confirm-email.md](auth/confirm-email.md) | Feature gap |
| Catalog (`/catalog`) | [catalog/course-catalog.md](catalog/course-catalog.md) | Feature gap |
| Course detail (`/courses/[slug]`) | [catalog/course-detail.md](catalog/course-detail.md) | Feature gap |
| Lesson player (`/courses/[slug]/lessons/[lessonId]`) | [catalog/lesson-player.md](catalog/lesson-player.md) | **Blocking** |
| My courses (`/my-courses`) | [catalog/my-courses.md](catalog/my-courses.md) | Feature gap |

## Skipped screens

Mockup screens evaluated and not (yet) built because the backend gap was
severe enough that shipping them would have meant either fabricating data
across the board or a workflow that silently loses admin work. No spec
exists for any of these; each is documented as a pendency only, to
revisit once its blocking gap(s) close on the CourseCore side.

| Screen | File | Why skipped |
|---|---|---|
| Checkout — Pix/cartão (`1i`) | [catalog/course-detail.md](catalog/course-detail.md) (pendency 6 update) | No payment/checkout endpoint at all — explicit backend non-goal, not just a missing field. |
| Painel admin — Cursos (`1k`) | [admin/courses-panel.md](admin/courses-panel.md) | Originally: no endpoint lists draft courses, no audit-log read endpoint. **Both appear resolved as of the 2026-09-07 backend snapshot** — `GET /api/courses` (`ListAllCoursesUseCase`) and `GET /api/audit-logs` (`AuditLogsController`) now exist; `Unpublish` and `PriceAmount` are also wired. The skip decision should be revisited before this screen is picked up again. |
| Áreas — lista / criar-editar (`1l`, `1m`) | [admin/areas-crud.md](admin/areas-crud.md) | **Resolved as of the 2026-09-07 backend snapshot** — per-area course count/list, an `AccentColor` field, and the delete-area decision (`Deactivate` as shipped "Excluir área", same choice as courses) are all wired. The skip decision should be revisited before this screen is picked up again. |
| Curso — criar/editar (`1n`) | [admin/course-crud.md](admin/course-crud.md) | **Resolved as of the 2026-09-07 backend snapshot** — `EnrollmentControlled` pricing model, `IssuesCertificate` opt-in, and module/lesson content management (see next row) are all wired; cover-image upload and course delete were deliberately kept out of scope (plain URL field, `Unpublish` respectively). The skip decision should be revisited before this screen is picked up again. |
| Curso → Módulos e aulas (`1o`) | [admin/course-modules-lessons.md](admin/course-modules-lessons.md) | **Built** — see `Docs/specs/admin/course-modules.md`. |
| Aula — criar/editar (`1p`) | [admin/lesson-editor.md](admin/lesson-editor.md) | **Built** — see `Docs/specs/admin/lesson-editor.md`. Module reassignment and direct order editing stay unbuilt (no backing endpoint); video registration ships as a YouTube-link form, not an upload. |
| Usuários — lista (`1q`) | [admin/users-panel.md](admin/users-panel.md) | **Built** — see `Docs/specs/admin/users-list.md`. Role read, area-grant read, aggregate counts, and search are all wired; no batch endpoint exists yet for area grants across multiple users (pendency 8), so the list fetches per row instead. |
| Usuário — editar acesso (`1r`) | [admin/users-panel.md](admin/users-panel.md) | Not specced yet — role assign/remove, area grant/revoke, blocking an account, and paid-course access grants are all real on the backend (pendencies 1, 2, 6) but have no screen built against them. |

New screens get their own file here as part of the standard spec workflow
(see `CLAUDE.md`, "Implementation Workflow") — add a row above when one is
created.
